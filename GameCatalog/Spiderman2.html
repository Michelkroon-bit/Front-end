        <li>
            "After a tremendous introduction to the superhero lives of Peter Parker and Miles Morales on PS4, Insomniac Games has crafted an even better adventure that showcases the true power of PS5 hardware. A game that is streamlined, ambitious, emotional, and showcases the true potential of the superhero genre in a gaming medium." <br><strong>-IGN: </strong> </p>
            
        </li>
        <li>
            "Spider-Man 2 is hands-down the best game of the PS5 era so far. It’s visually stunning, narratively brilliant, and somehow manages to improve Insomniac’s already stellar traversal and combat from previous Spidey games. It’s a masterpiece." <br><strong>-The loadout: </strong> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            "Full of emotional highs that will make you get out of your chair and cheer at the screen in a way that few games have managed to achieve in recent memory, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 represents Insomniac Games operating at the apex of its considerable powers. Spectacular and amazing, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is a superior, spectacle stuffed action adventure that provides players with the ultimate superhero fantasy. Full of surprising heart and delicate moments that balance beautifully with the sort of blockbuster superhero bombast that its developer has refined to a fine art, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is a toweringly polished, unparalleled masterwork that redefines the superhero video game genre at large and is better than the previous two games in every way imaginable. This is exactly what you've been waiting for."<br><strong>-PlayStation Universe: </strong> </p>
